Project Name:
112 Dynamic Defense

Description:
To play the game, place towers on the map by dragging the buttons. Enemies come from entrances as shown by red arrows at the beginning of rounds. The enemies get progressively harder, so find a way to build a maze of towers and stop them!

Modules:
For the base game, no modules required. However, to run multiplayer, you need websockets installed. To install, use pip install websockets.

Shortcuts:
r: skip a round immediately
showmethemoney (type during gameplay): gives 100000 coins
showmethelives (type during gameplay): gives 100000 health

Note: multiplayer is very early, and I don't think it will run properly. The game shouldn't crash if the multiplayer button isn't clicked, but if it is, I can't guarantee anything.
