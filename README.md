# CMU-15-112
This is the CMU 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming course taken in the summer of '22 as a high schooler.
In it you will find my code for all homework (don't copy or you'll get an AIV!) and the term project.
Be sure to check out the term project! It is a really interesting tower defense with a very bare-bones multiplayer,
and got a tied third in the popular vote for the project showcase.
Many thanks to the TA's, friends, and Prof. Taylor who made this course so fun!
